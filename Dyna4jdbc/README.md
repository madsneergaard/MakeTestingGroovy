Dyna4jdbc
=========

Rather than being a web testing framework, dyna4jdbc is a database
emulation tool. The output of running a script should be a delimited
set of column names followed by delimited rows of data. Dyna4jdbc
re-purposes the scripts output and makes it available as if from
a database table. This can be useful when trying to replace a real
database during system testing or to allow non-database information
to be amenable to database reporting tools.
