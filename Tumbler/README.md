Tumbler
=======

It is recommended you run this project use gradle rather than your IDE; otherwise,
the report directory location might be determined by what working directory your
IDE uses when running the file.

To use gradle, the predefined `run` task can be used.

The Tumbler project is dormant but it provides a very simplistic BDD style report
that is sometimes useful. Further info:
