WebTest
=======

WebTest isn't being actively worked on at present but is still useful in some scenarios.

To invoke the XML ant file, ensure that Apache Ant is on your PATH and then execute:

```
./ant -f TestSimpBlogWebTest.xml (the ./ at the start isn't needed for Windows)
```

To invoke the Groovy variant, execute the script in the `src/test/groovy` folder with Groovy.
