Arquillian
==========

To test using Arquillian, run the `TestSimpBlogArquillian.groovy` test in your IDE
or from gradle using:

```
> ./gradlew :Arquillian:run
```

When using your IDE, check that the working directory is the Arquillian subproject directory.

[NOTE]
=========================================
Currently the `@Deployment` feature (which is why you'd want to use Arquillian)
doesn't work and is currently side-stepped by pointing `deploymentURL` to the external
embedded jetty.

Error message:

```
org.springframework.orm.hibernate5.HibernateSystemException
       ...
Caused by: org.hibernate.HibernateException: Javassist Enhancement failed: class simpblog.Category
       ...
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalAccessError: tried to access class org.grails.orm.hibernate.proxy.HibernateGroovyObjectMethodHandler from class org.grails.orm.hibernate.proxy.GroovyAwareJavassistLazyInitializer
        at org.grails.orm.hibernate.proxy.GroovyAwareJavassistLazyInitializer.<init>(GroovyAwareJavassistLazyInitializer.java)
```

The referenced `GroovyAwareJavassistLazyInitializer` class is created dynamically within `org.grails.orm.hibernate.proxy.ProxyFactorySupport`. The classloader regime expected by GORM is different to that supplied by Arquillian.
