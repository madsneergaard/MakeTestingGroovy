= Simple Blog Test Application

To run the application, use a separate terminal/command prompt
and type the following gradle command (skip the initial `./` when using windows):

```
> ./gradlew :AppUnderTest:run
```

Browse the application at the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/

If at any point you want to clean out blog entries you have
added from previous tests, you can use:

http://localhost:8080/reset
