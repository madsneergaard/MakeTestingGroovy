# start docs

The base SetUp page always needs the Import table at the top of this one to allow the fixture unqualified fixture name in test tables.

The second table sets some common configuration options for the fixture.  

Always turn Preserve on so that named DOM elements persist between tables.  

The Clear statement empties the DOM element storage at the start of each test.

The Set User Agent command was required for the yahoo search test - yahoo doesn't return results unless the request has a User Agent that looks like a real browser.

Show Javascript Errors off makes htmlunit behave like a real browser - if errors in javascript are encountered, they are ignored and the test continues (the error still gets appended to the error logs for the test).

Show SSL Errors off is a nice option for testing SSL on a test site with a fake or expired certificate.

Suites that have special SetUp needs should all include this SetUp page in their SetUp
