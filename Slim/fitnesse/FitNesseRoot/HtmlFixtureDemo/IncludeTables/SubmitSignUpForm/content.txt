This is a typical include page for submitting a form.  

Note that since the Element Focus command only searches the children (recursively) of the current focus element, it is necessary to return to the form element in between each Element Focus command for the inputs of the form.

It is a good practice to display the form on the first and last focus command by placing an empty cell after the name cell in the focus command.  This makes test page easy to read and also easy to see if something has gone wrong with the navigation that brings you to the form element.  I also tend to display the button before the Click command to enhance test results readability.

In this demo, since the "application under test" just has a single form, the page starts with a URL.  In actual practice, most include tables start by focusing on resultPage (this one would be preceded by a table that would for example click on the signup link on the home page and store the result in resultPage).
