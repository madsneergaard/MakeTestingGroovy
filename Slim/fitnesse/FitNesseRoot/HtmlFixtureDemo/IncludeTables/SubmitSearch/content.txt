This page demonstrates a few commands that are useful when the DOM of the application under test is lacking in id and name attributes.  This page can be used to submit the search form on either www.google.com or www.yahoo.com.  

The Focus Parent Type command moves up the DOM from the current focus element via parent elements until it finds the first element of he indicated type.  Here it is used to focus on the form element that contains the named query input even though the form element may not have an id and there may be various DOM levels between the input and the enclosing form.

The Attribute Focus command searches in the children of the current focus element for an element with the given attribute value.  In this example, it allows us to focus on the submit button by its value attribute even though the submit button may not have an id or name.
